This is my personal website where I (plan to) showcase some of my work in [mathematics](https://fekonrad.github.io/math/) and [machine learning](https://fekonrad.github.io/ML/). 

Currently I'm a mathematics master's student at the University of Bonn where I specialize in Probability Theory, Machine Learning and Analysis. 
In February 2024 I'm joining the [Mathematical Machine Learning Group](https://www.mis.mpg.de/mathematical-machine-learning) at the Max-Planck Institute for Mathtematics in the Sciences in Leipzig.
