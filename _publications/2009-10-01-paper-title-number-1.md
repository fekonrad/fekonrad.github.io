My thesis on the tail measure for continuous-time càdlàg processes. It surveys prerequisite material in multivariate extreme value theory (chapter 2), weak convergence of continuous-time stochastic processes (chapter 3) and the results given in the recent [paper of Philippe Soulier](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00325.pdf) (chapter 4). Additionally, we present some applications for regularly varying Markov Processes (chapter 5).

Note that there are some errors in chapter 5. Specifically, the proof of Theorem 5.10 contains some errors and Proposition 5.9 is missing the assumption of X being regularly varying.
